 <h2> How will my money be used? </h2>

     <span>Your money will be used to pay for the costs of running The Odin Project. This includes paying for the <br>
      servers that host the website, the domain name, and any other costs associated with running the project. <br>
      Your money does not go towards paying the maintainers. All of our expenses are documented directly on <br>
      the Open Collective website.</span>

<h2>How can I donate?</h2>

<span>You can donate via Open Collective, by setting up a recurring donation or with a one time payment.</span>

<h2>What form of payments can I use?</h2>

<span>You can usually pay by credit card through our Open Collective page. They also offer bank transfer, Paypal, <br>
     or other means in addition to or instead of credit card payments. When you go through the contribution <br>
      flow, you'll see all the available payment methods.</span>

<h2>What happens if you receive more donations than needed?</h2>
<span>Any extra money that we receive will be used to improve The Odin Project, or will be saved for future <br>
     needs. This includes paying for new features, paying for new servers, and paying for any other costs <br>
      associated with running the project.</span>

<h2>How do I cancel my recurring donation?</h2>
<span>You can cancel your recurring donation at any time through your Open Collective profile.</span>

<h2>What are the benefits of donating?</h2>
<span>Your donation helps us continue to provide a world-class and completely free coding curriculum for anyone <br>
     and everyone eager to learn. We believe that this material should be available for free to anyone that needs <br>
      it, and donations from those that have the means to contribute help keep it available for everyone!</span>

<span>In additon to the above, donors get a special 'backer' role in our discord server as a small bit of recognition.</span>

<h2>How do I get the 'backer' role on Discord?</h2>
<span>Use the /opencollective command in our discord server to verify your Open Collective account. You will <br> 
    then be automatically given the 'backer' role. You will be prompted to provide your Open Collective <br> 
     username, which is found in the URL of your Open Collective profile. For example, if your profile URL is <br>
      https://opencollective.com/rick-astley your username is rick-astley.</span>

<span>If you want to remove the role for any reason, contact staff on discord through ModMail.</span>

<h2>Do users with the 'backer' role get any exclusive benefits?</h2>
<span>No. The role is just a way for us to show our appreciation for your support.</span>

<h2>Does becoming a donor mean I get priority support in the chat?</h2>
<span>No. We feel strongly that everyone should be treated equally in our community, regardless of whether or <br>
     not they are a donor.

<h2>I cannot afford to donate right now. What are some other ways I can help The Odin Project?</h2>
<span>You can help us by contributing to our open source projects. You can also help us by spreading the word <br>
     about The Odin Project. Tell your friends, family, and coworkers about us. Share our content on social <br>
     media. The more people that know about us, the more people we can help.</span>

<h2>What ever happened to Thinkful? Viking Code School?</h2>
 <span>When The Odin Project was created by Eric Trautman in 2013, it was primarily funded by Eric's other <br>
     project, the for-profit Viking Code School. Eric wanted Odin to be free, and kept it that way by placing a <br>
      small ad for Viking Code School on the website.</span>

<span>In late 2017, Viking Code School was acquired by Thinkful. As a part of that acquisition, Thinkful agreed to <br>
     continue funding The Odin Project, in return for an ad on The Odin Project website.</span>

<span>In 2019, Thinkful was acquired by Chegg. Chegg was nothing but supportive, and continued funding us the <br>
    entire time. However we began to feel that it might be in our best interest to become self-funding, to avoid <br>
     the risk of being acquired by a company that might not be as supportive.</span>

<span>In 2023, we decided to begin the process of parting ways with Chegg, and become self-funding. We are <br>
     now funded entirely by donations.</span>

<h2>I still have questions. How can I contact you?</h2>
<span>You can contact us through modmail on our discord server, or through email. See our contact us page for <br>
 details.</span>
